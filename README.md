Frontend brief responses application for the digital marketplace.

- Python app, based on the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

## Quickstart

Install dependencies, build assets and run the app
```
make run-all
```

Debian (jessie) users will need `libxslt1-dev` and `libxml2-dev` installed for `requirements-dev`.

## Full setup

Create a virtual environment
 ```
 python3 -m venv ./venv
 ```

### Activate the virtual environment

```
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Upgrade dependencies

Install new Python dependencies with pip

```make requirements-dev```


## Front-end

Front-end code (both development and production) is compiled using [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

### Requirements

You need Node (try to install the version we use in production -
 see the [base docker image](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-docker-base/blob/master/base.docker)).

To check the version you're running, type:

```
node --version
```

## Frontend tasks

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) is used for all frontend build tasks. The commands available are:

- `npm run frontend-build:development` (compile the frontend files for development)
- `npm run frontend-build:production` (compile the frontend files for production)
- `npm run frontend-build:watch` (watch all frontend files & rebuild when anything changes)





### Run the tests

To run the whole testsuite:

```
make test
```

To test individual parts of the test stack use the `test-flake8`, `test-python`
or `test-javascript` targets.

eg.
```
make test-javascript
```

### Run the development server

To run the briefs responses frontend app for local development use the `run-all` target.
This will install requirements, build assets and run the app.

```
make run-all
```

To just run the application use the `run-app` target.

Use the app at http://127.0.0.1:5006/suppliers/opportunities.

When using the development server the brief responses frontend runs on port 5006 by default.
This can be changed by setting the `DM_BRIEF_RESPONSES_PORT` environment variable, e.g.
to set the port number to 9006:
```
export DM_BRIEF_RESPONSES_PORT=9006
```

Note: The login is located in the user frontend application, so this needs to be running as well to login as a supplier.

If the application is running on port 5006 as described above, login from
http://127.0.0.1:5007/login (user frontend) as a supplier and then you will be
logged in as a supplier on http://127.0.0.1:5006/suppliers/opportunities.

It is easier to use the apps if nginx is configured to run them through one port.
As described in the Digital Marketplace manual section on [accessing frontend
applications as a single website][manual-nginx]:

> The frontend applications are hyperlinked together but are running on
> different ports. This can cause links to error when they link between
> different applications. The way around this is to set up nginx so all front
> end applications can be accessed through port 80.

The easiest way to do this is to use [`dmrunner`](https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-runner).

In this case all the frontend applications will available from port 80 (usually
aliased to localhost) and the brief responses application can be accessed from
http://localhost/suppliers/opportunities.

### Updating application dependencies

`requirements.txt` file is generated from the `requirements-app.txt` in order to pin
versions of all nested dependecies. If `requirements-app.txt` has been changed (or
we want to update the unpinned nested dependencies) `requirements.txt` should be
regenerated with

```
make freeze-requirements
```

`requirements.txt` should be commited alongside `requirements-app.txt` changes.
